Next.js experiment to see if we can have domain based locales with static optimization by rewriting URLs on the server to prepend the locale.

- [x] Setup example repo with custom server
- [x] Global CSS
- [x] Component CSS
- [x] Static HTML
- [x] `getInitialProps` page
- [x] `getServerSideProps` page
- [x] `getStaticPaths` page
- [x] `getStaticProps` page
- [x] Setup hosts file with language domains and international subdomains
- [ ] Move pages inside [locale] dynamic directory and add i18n
- [ ] Write server middleware
- [ ] Make sure API routes still work (not sure if we need this)
